# GitHub Actions Test

This repository is for **learning and testing GitHub Actions**.

## 🚀 What It Does

It includes a simple workflow that runs a one-line script to print a message:

```
Hello from GitHub Actions!
```

## 🧩 Workflow Details

* **File:** `.github/workflows/hello.yml`
* **Triggers:**

  * When code is pushed to the `main` branch
  * When a pull request targets the `main` branch
  * When manually triggered using **workflow dispatch**
